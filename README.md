How It Works
SearchVian operates by taking the user's search input and sending it through the Google Search API via RapidAPI. The API returns search results that are parsed and displayed on the front-end in a structured format. Users can either choose to view web-based search results or switch to image search mode to view a gallery of images related to their query.

User submits a search query
Users type their queries into the search bar and press enter. The query is sent to the Google Search API.

Backend processing using Node.js
The query is handled by a Node.js backend, which forwards it to the Google Search API, ensuring fast and secure data transmission.

Displaying results on the frontend with React.js
The React.js frontend receives the data from the backend and dynamically displays the search results in an easy-to-navigate format.
